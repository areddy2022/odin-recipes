    <h5><strong>From Ministry of Curry:</strong> Paneer Butter Masala is a classic Indian dish with a creamy tomato-based sauce and luscious cubes of paneer dunked in it. This lightly spiced curry is easy to make and a crowd-pleaser, so go ahead and make it for a weeknight dinner or for your next get-together. I am also sharing some fun options to serve this finger-licking delish curry.</h5>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion finely diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Kashmiri red chilli powder or another mild red chili powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato puree canned or 2 to 3 ripe tomatoes, pureed</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 pound paneer cut into ½-inch cubes</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried fenugreek leaves optional</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the high Sauté setting on the Instant Pot and heat the ghee. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, chile powder, salt, and turmeric and sauté until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add the tomato puree and water and stir to combine. Layer over the garam masala, but do not mix.</li>
        <li>Secure the lid and set the Pressure Release to Sealing. Press the Cancel button to reset the cooking program, then select the Pressure Cook or Manual setting and set the cooking time for 8 minutes on high pressure.</li>
        <li>Perform a quick release by moving the Pressure Release Valve to Venting. Open the pot and blend the sauce to a smooth consistency using an immersion blender. Stir in the paneer, cream, tomato paste, fenugreek leaves, and sugar. Select the high Sauté setting and cook until the curry comes to a gentle boil, about 5 minutes. Press the Cancel button to turn off the Instant Pot. Garnish with cilantro & serve.</li>
