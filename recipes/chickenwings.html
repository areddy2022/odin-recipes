    <h5><strong>From allrecipes:</strong> I love to get mango-habanero wings at restaurants, so I set out to create my own recipe. After trying many online recipes, I combined different ideas and came up with this one. It's always a hit when I make it, and everyone asks me for the recipe. Coating the wings in cornstarch absorbs extra moisture and forms a very thin, crispy crust. It's not a heavy breading; it just adds a bit of crunch.</h4>
